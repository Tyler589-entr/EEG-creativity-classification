# EEG-Creativity-Classification

Classifying creative vs. non-creative cognitive states using EEG data and a CNN with attention.

## 🧠 EEG-Based Scientific Creativity Classification

This project uses an attention-enhanced Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify human cognitive states as **Creative** or **Non-Creative** based on EEG signals.
